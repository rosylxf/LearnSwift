  How to read
  ===========

  If you're reading on OS X or iOS, open the ePub in iBooks for the best
  reading experience – it has an interactive table of contents, clickable
  links, and more.

  If you want to print a copy of the book, open the PDF.

  If you're reading on Kindle, open the Mobi file.

  For everything else, use the HTML files.
